# kivy_st_widgets
Standard widgets for use on Android with kivy
The purpose of this project is to create some standard useful widgets that you often will need to create your app.

First of all 
want to obtain this: https://developer.android.com/training/keyboard-input/style.html
for keyboard input.

1. The widget is a TEXTINPUT that accepts ONLY NUMBERS.
PROBLEM: VirtualKeyboard appears in desktop mode but in android is overlapped by the system keyboard

# kivy_st_widgets
Standard widgets for use on Android with kivy

The purpose of this project is to create some standard useful widgets that you often will need to create your app.
The first widget is a TEXTBOX that accepts ONLY NUMBERS.
TODO:
- the widget should sow when touched a NUMERIC KEYBOARD not the letters. At the moment it filters your input but a standard keyboard is shown.
